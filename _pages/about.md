I am a PhD student studying Information Science and Technology at Syracuse University School of Information Studies. Currently I am a research assistant in the <a href="https://lab.metadataetc.org/">Metadata Lab</a>. I have a MS degree in Library and Information Science (SU, G'23) and a BS degree in Biological Sciences (CNU, G'19). My research interests are in metadata, knowledge organization, and science of science, especially within biomedical science and scientometrics. I have some experience in using social network analysis and qualitative interviews, but mainly I use quantitative methods to conduct research.

I enjoy jigsaw puzzles and Lego. I'm good at swimming. I do a little bit of calligraphy and drawing. Also trying to learn French. Consider myself a fairly good cook and a HUGE fan of Zelda.
